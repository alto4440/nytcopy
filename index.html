                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>

            <p>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of
                light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and
                not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities.
                Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                whether
                it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
                of
                dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
                space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
                its
                hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                of
                other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over
                ‘As Big as It Gets’
            </p>

            <p>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
                would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
                general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
                said,
                “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                gravitational
                waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates
                space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
                the
                sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic
                Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics
                here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
                expected such a definite
                confirmation in his
                lifetime.

                “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
                Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
                meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
                Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose
                his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

                Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
                known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
                Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle
                of Champagne to tell him the news.

                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.

            </p>
            <p>
                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that
                we ordered
                anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having
                news like this
                is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
            <p>
                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
                astrophysicists
                responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go
                down
                as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
            </p>

            <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called
                the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and
                very
                convincing,” he said.

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
                light
                waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
                waves,
                squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction
                of
                polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should
                have
                little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
                microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

            <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>

            <p>
                The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
                supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
                breakthrough.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
                deeper
                into the past.
            </p>
            <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
                forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part
                of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
